# Pixelator App

<p>This is an extension of my Code in Place final 2021 final project.  The first goal is to implement a GUI for
the pixelator program for easier use.  The second goal is to implement a HSL comparison tool to compare the 
target image with a palette of colors using HSL instead of RGB. 
</p>

### Here is an example of the program:

target image:<br>
![Image of Landscape](Images/landscape.jpg)

Pixelated image:<br>
![Pixelated landscape](Pixel%20Images/pixelimage.png)
