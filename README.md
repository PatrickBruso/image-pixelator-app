# Pixelator App

<p>This is an extension of my Code in Place final 2021 final project.  The first goal is to implement a GUI for
the pixelator program for easier use. This is currently being worked on using both Tkinter and PySimpleGUI.
The second goal is to implement a HSL comparison tool to compare the target image with a palette of colors using 
HSL instead of RGB. 
</p>

The next steps are to implement the following within the GUI:

* [x] Load image to pixelate
* [x] Dropdown list of palettes to choose from
    * [ ] Some way to view palettes to make choice
* [x] Call pixelate file upon image when Pixelate! button is clicked
* [ ] Show pixelated copy of image
* [ ] Ability to save pixelated image to disk

### Here is an example of the program:

target image:<br>
![Image of Landscape](Images/landscape.jpg)

Pixelated image:<br>
![Pixelated landscape](Pixel%20Images/pixelimage.png)
